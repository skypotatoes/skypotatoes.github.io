      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated this blog in a while. I have put Codewars katas aside for the moment as we are covering a lot each day on Northcoders. We have been introduced to TDD or Test Driven Development, using Jest to run tests on our functions as we write them, creating and passing progressively more complex tests until a final function is arrived reached. We are doing this in pairs on most days, periodically switching roles between &amp;lsquo;driver&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;navigator&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Wednesday today and, since Monday, the Northcoders bootcamp has been getting us into the rhythm of a morning lecture around 9am, followed by smaller seminar group lesson, and then &amp;lsquo;sprinting&amp;rsquo; with a partner. A sprint is some particular coding exercise or set of exercises, to be completed within a given. At the moment they&amp;rsquo;re throwing at us fairly simple but challenging problems while we get used to &amp;lsquo;pairing&amp;rsquo;,i.e. working as a pair.</description>

      <title>Solved Minimum Number of Coins Kata</title>

      <description>I eventually solved this Kata and it&amp;rsquo;s the first one I have come across which I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy doing. I found the challenge to lack any consistency in what inputs were considered valid or invalid, and in the end it became a case of simply filtering out the edge cases through if-statements. It seemed entirely capricious as to why it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t accept .5 but would accept .16, £1p was valid but £.</description>

      <title>Kata: Minimum Number of Coins</title>

      <description>This evening I decided to have a go at the kata &amp;ldquo;Minimum Number of Coins&amp;rdquo;. The first challenge in this kata is to validate the number given which can be quite varied. The amount may be either a number or a string. If it is a string, it may or may not be prefixed with &amp;ldquo;£&amp;rdquo; or suffixed with &amp;ldquo;p&amp;rdquo;. If it is a number, it can be either an integer or a float.</description>

      <description>Last night I followed this tutorial to build this blog that runs off a github repo. I thought this would be a better way to keep a track of my progress as a coder than merely keeping a repo filled with commented .js files, which I was doing here. I thought about moving everything over and formatting each item as a blog post, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s really necessary. This blog will be used for updates and thoughts on problems I am working on and things that I am learning.</description>
