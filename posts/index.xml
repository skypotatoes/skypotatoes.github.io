      <description>Last night I followed this tutorial to build this blog that runs off a github repo. I thought this would be a better way to keep a track of my progress as a coder than merely keeping a repo filled with commented .js files, which I was doing here. I thought about moving everything over and formatting each item as a blog post, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s really necessary. This blog will be used for updates and thoughts on problems I am working on and things that I am learning.</description>
