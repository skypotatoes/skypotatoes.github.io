  <p>Last night I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4">this tutorial</a> to build this blog that runs off a github repo. I thought
this would be a better way to keep a track of my progress as a coder than merely keeping a repo filled with commented .js files, which I was doing <a href="https://github.com/skypotatoes/devlog">here</a>. I thought about moving everything over and formatting each item as a blog post, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really necessary. This blog will be used for updates and thoughts
on problems I am working on and things that I am learning.</p>
<p>Today was Day 2 of the Northcoders bootcamp which I am enrolled on. Today we covered functions and objects, and solved a bunch of problems kept over <a href="https://github.com/skypotatoes/remote-intro-week%22">here</a>. Most of what we covered today was a reminder of things I have already learned through FreeCodeCamp and solving katas on Codewars. I believe I used a few
object methods that I haven&rsquo;t used before, but don&rsquo;t remember which off the top of my head. It was mainly a matter of googling to find an appropriate method for the job. It seems like
that is a key skill for a coder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now, see you on the next post.</p>
