      <description>This evening I decided to have a go at the kata &amp;ldquo;Minimum Number of Coins&amp;rdquo;. The first challenge in this kata is to validate the number given which can be quite varied. The amount may be either a number or a string. If it is a string, it may or may not be prefixed with &amp;ldquo;Â£&amp;rdquo; or suffixed with &amp;ldquo;p&amp;rdquo;. If it is a number, it can be either an integer or a float.</description>

      <description>Last night I followed this tutorial to build this blog that runs off a github repo. I thought this would be a better way to keep a track of my progress as a coder than merely keeping a repo filled with commented .js files, which I was doing here. I thought about moving everything over and formatting each item as a blog post, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s really necessary. This blog will be used for updates and thoughts on problems I am working on and things that I am learning.</description>
